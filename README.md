# Requirements-Engineering
This document describes the requirements of the Recipeasy case study proposed as student project in the RE course, aa. 2019-2020. It specifically presents the proposed application to facilitate the process of finding recipes. This case study aims to evaluate and define the issues of the current situation and their possible solutions with an overview of goal-oriented requirements for both the as-is and to-be cases. In addition to this, a clear schedule of activities and requirements needed to develop the program is provided. Recipeasy is a service available to everyone that allows users to obtain recipes by selecting ingredients they already have on hand and that they want to cook. Moreover, the app offers an innovative approach to the recipe finding process by suggesting to the user recipes filtered based on their personal needs and by allowing them to buy missing ingredients through the app. In order to understand the elements to be added or modified to improve the system, a survey has been conducted and taken into consideration for the aim of developing the to-be model. The document also contains an OO requirements analysis with the use case, sequence model and class model, traceability matrices that show the relationships between requirements, prioritization to ensures that the project focuses on the most important elements first and eventually the user feedback analysis.
